# Share Bots

After you are done publishing the bot, you can share your bot through social media or any other platform. To share your bot simply click on the menu icon that is visible on the top right corner of the bot card.

You can either copy the link to your bot and share it separately, or directly select the social sharing option which will alow you to directly share it through your social media account. &#x20;
