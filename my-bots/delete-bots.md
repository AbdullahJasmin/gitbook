# Delete Bots

If you want to delete your bot, that too is possible through the My Bots section. To delete your bot, click on the menu icon on the top right corner of the bot card.

Then you can view a small drop-down menu which includes edit bot, share and remove. Select the "remove" option, and a popup will appear asking for confirmation to remove the bot.

Then you can simply click on "Remove", and your bot will be removed from your bot grid.
