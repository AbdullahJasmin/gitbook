# Bot Badges

There are three types of auto-generated bot badges that are available to the bots. These are the Trending, Verified and User-based badges.&#x20;

As you can see above, there are different meanings for each badge. You can acquire these badges one by one as your bot gains traction.

These badges are visible on your bot card, as shown below.

If you click on one of these badges, a modal will prompt up, showing the information related to each specific badge.

Again, if you click on the phrase "Read more about badges" on these modals, you will be directed to the "Guides" page that was mentioned first.
