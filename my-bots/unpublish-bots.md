# Unpublish Bots

After you are done publishing a bot, you can also unpublish it at any time. To unpublish your bot, simply click on the menu icon that is visible on the top right corner of the bot card.

You can view a small drop-down menu, which includes edit bot, share, unpublish, make it personal, and remove. Select the "unpublish and make it personal" option, and a popup will appear asking for confirmation.

Then you can simply click on "unpublish", and your bot will be unpublished.

When the user unpublishes a bot, the card switches its appearance. We changed the state indicator from Public to Personal and showed the Publish Bot button instead of the usage and likes indicator.
