# Viewing Bot Details

In case you are curious about the Bot you are conversing with, you can easily find out more information about the bot.

You can learn more about the bot by simply clicking on the bot's name in the top menu, and you will see this popup that provides you with more information. You can use this interface to delete your conversation and even voice your feedback about the bot.

This also works for transferred bots, as shown below.

Now that you have obtained information about the bot, you may want to find out what source the bot referred to when providing your response. We will illustrate how you can check this on the next page.
