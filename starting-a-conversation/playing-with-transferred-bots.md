# Playing with Transferred Bots

ConvoGrid does not limit you to bots that were created via the platform itself, instead, you can also interact with bots that are transferred from other platforms, as shown below.

You can bring over your bots from other platforms by following the guide in the [Importing Bots from another platform](../my-bots/creating-a-bot/selecting-the-content/importing-bots-from-another-platform.md) section.

We will be showing you how you can find details about the bot on the next page.
