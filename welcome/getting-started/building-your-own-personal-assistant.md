# Building your own personal assistant

ConvoGrid doesn't limit you to just being a content creator or a content consumer; in fact, it actually enables you to achieve more by enabling you to build your own chatbot using any content available.

## **ðŸš€ Build your own assistant**

* You can make your own personal chatbot by checking out the [My Bots section](broken-reference), which details how you can [create a bot](../../my-bots/creating-a-bot/) or even [bring over your bots from other platforms](../../my-bots/creating-a-bot/selecting-the-content/importing-bots-from-another-platform.md) by guiding you in this process.
* If you choose not to publish this bot, it will remain as a private chatbot that you can use as a personal assistant to assist you in your tasks, be it entertainment, education, etc.
* You can[ try out this bot](../../my-bots/try-bots.md), and if you feel ready to share this bot with the world, you can easily [publish the bot](../../my-bots/creating-a-bot/publishing-the-bot.md) and become a content creator on ConvoGrid as well.
